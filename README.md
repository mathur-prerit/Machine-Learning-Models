# Machine-Learning-Models
This Repository contain algorithms which are used in data science and machine learning.

It was used implemented using <b> Python</b> and its libraries: <b> scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras, ntlk, numpy, pandas, matplotlib</b> etc. It can be used to create various types of models.

It contain simple implementation of data science and machine learning algorithms. Most of the datasets are uploaded with the code.
This respository consists of:-

1. <b> Regression </b> (Linear, Polynomial, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest regression models).
2. <b> Classification </b> (SVM, kernel SVM, Logistic Regression,Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours classification models).
3. <b> Clustering </b> (K-Means, Hierrachical clustering models).
4. <b> Deep Learning Algorithms </b> (Artifical Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks).

And many other things like:-
1. <b> Natural Language Processing </b>
2. <b> Reinforcement Learning Models </b> 
3. <b> Assoication Rule Learning Model </b>
4. <b> XGBoost </b>
5. <b> Model Selection Algorithms </b>
6. <b> Data Preprocessing parameters</b>

I will add more algorithms in the future.
